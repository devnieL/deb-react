# Devniel Express Boilerplate for React.js

With this boilerplate you could render React components on server and mount it on the browser (supporting interactivity) throught its re-rendering once it's static loaded.

It's intended to be used on projects with different modules (authentication, administration, landing, etc.) and you want to integrate them with information on your server side such as a session.

Your app views should be put on **app/views** while the required files that recover the interactivity (that produce the build file and is included in the browser) should be placed on **app/dist**.
